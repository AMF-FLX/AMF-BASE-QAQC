Multivariate relations (e.g., WS vs USTAR, PPFD_IN vs SW_IN) are also analyzed to detect potentially erroneous data. The comparison of measured radiation (e.g., PPFD_IN, SW_IN) to the maximum, top of the atmosphere radiation expected for a given location (i.e., SW_IN_POT) is also analyzed to check the timestamp specification and alignment. Details of each Data QA/QC check module can be found at [Data QA/QC|{ui}data/flux-data-products/data-qaqc/].",
